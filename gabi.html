			<h2> Why Coding? </h2>

			<p>I am <b>excited</b> about learning how to code because: </p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>I like to make things.</li>
				<li>I want to participate in the future.</li>
				<li>And being a <i>coder</i> sounds awesome!</li>
			</ul>

			<p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br> <br>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
